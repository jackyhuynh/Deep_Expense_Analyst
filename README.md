# Exepense_Tracking_and_Analysis

## Introduction
The Expense Tracking and Analysis is a web application that built with Microsoft Visual Studio and C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. The app features password complexity and encryption and allowing multiple users to get access to the resource with the right username and password. It is also implemented Microsoft AI platform to maximize user’s experience.
Its function is fairly simple, Expense Tracking allows user to track their expense in that month (or a period). The app will category the user’s expense base on a server’s database. The user also has the power to change the expense category, track their expense, change user profile, card details, personal info, and so much more. The Expense Tracking and Analysis also feature with AI to advise user with better spending habit (base on a user’s database and machine learning methodologies)

- The basic idea of the project is to categorize the credit card expenses based on location, time, date, type of category the expense falls into and display (visualize the data) in the form of charts/graphs. 
- We are expected to include 4/5 categories.
- Examples of categories are : Pharmacy,Doctors,Daycare,Schools,Restaurants,Entertainment(movies,game zones),Shopping etc.
- We should also include the different states the user travels and the type of expenses in each state.

### We should be able to build the following prototype(Web application) of the system:
    - Design a database
    - Build GUI
    - Dashboard which generates 2/3 graphs 
    - User should be able to view the transaction and update the category if he would like to.
    - Once the transaction is entered into the table, it should be picked up right away into a category by running a script.
    - Simulate and generate the report.


### Component (Truc Suggestion):
    - Back End (Database/Sever): C#, Java
    - Front End (Gui, Database/Client/Machine Learning): R, Python, JavaScript, HTML
    - Development Tool?

Minutes of Meeting (MOM) 

Date: 02-18-2021 

Client: Dr. Khalifa 

Agenda: Presentation and feedback on Use case diagram, UI prototypes and database plan 

Truc presented Use Case diagram.  

Feedback: All the functions that user has have been covered. However, instead of ‘View Spending Advice’ one could mention only ‘View Charts’. 

Swetha presented UI prototypes.  

Feedback:  The category of the transaction should be displayed as an icon. User can click on the icon and make changes to the category if they want to. This way category is understood visually. 

Wrucha presented database plan. 

Feedback: Encrypt the sensitive data such as SSN or credit card number while storing in database. Also, include location where the transaction takes place. 

Kristina talked about the types of graphs the system plan to display. 

Central idea should be to display maximum expenditure data visually. The criterion for expenditure analysis should include – categorical expenditure, location-based expenditure (using GPS co-ordinates on the map where the user would be able to zoom in on a location), expenditure over time period(s) (week, month, year). 

Classify the transaction on where they were processed – online or at outlet/store locations. 

Future scopes -  

Find patterns and comparisons from user’s previous transactions and by pulling data between all users.

    - Dashboard which generates 2/3 graphs 
    - User should be able to view the transaction and update the category if he would like to.
    - Once the transaction is entered into the table, it should be picked up right away into a category by running a script.
    - Simulate and generate the report.


### Component:
    - Back End (Database/Sever): MySQL, R
    - Front End (Gui, Database/Client/Machine Learning): R, Python, JavaScript, HTML
    - Development Tool?
